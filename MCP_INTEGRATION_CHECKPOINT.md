### PHASE 1.3: Basic MCP Service
- ✅ Created services/mcp-client-service.ts
- ✅ Created services/mcp-server-manager.ts (simplified for single server)
- ✅ Implemented server connection management
- ✅ Added server lifecycle management
- ✅ Implemented initialization and cleanup

### PHASE 1.4: Error Handling
- ✅ Created unified error system (errors.ts)
- ✅ Implemented MCP-specific error types
- ✅ Added error handling utilities
- ✅ Integrated error handling across services

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### PHASE 2: MCP Client Integration
#### Core Integration
- ✅ Created MCPClientService class
- ✅ Implemented stdio transport
- ✅ Added server initialization
- ✅ Implemented tool discovery
- 🚧 Complete tool registration system
- 🚧 Add tool validation

### PHASE 3: AI Service Integration
#### AI Service Updates
- ✅ Modify OpenAIService and AnthropicService
- ✅ Add MCP context support
- ✅ Implement basic conversation memory (10 messages)
- ✅ Integrate DatabaseService with MCPServerManager
- ✅ Clean up dependency injection

#### Conversation Management
- ✅ Implemented message history in AI responses
- ✅ Added MAX_CONTEXT_MESSAGES limit (10 messages)
- ✅ Integrated tools context with conversation history
- ✅ Added message filtering (user/assistant only)

### PHASE 4: Interface Updates
#### CLI Updates
New commands to implement:
- ⏳ mcp:start - Start the MCP server
- ⏳ mcp:stop - Stop the MCP server
- ⏳ mcp:status - Show server status
- ⏳ mcp:tools - List available tools

#### Discord Updates
- ✅ Added basic error handling
- 🚧 Add MCP server status command
- ⏳ Implement tool usage in Discord

### PHASE 5: Memory Management Improvements
#### Conversation Enhancement
- 🚧 Implement conversation summarization
- 🚧 Add dynamic context window sizing
- ⏳ Add importance-based message filtering
- ⏳ Implement conversation checkpointing

#### Memory Optimization
- ⏳ Add token-based context limiting
- ⏳ Implement memory compression
- ⏳ Add conversation state management
- ⏳ Create conversation indexing system

## Potential Improvements
1. Conversation Memory Management
   - Increase context window size with token-based limits
   - Add conversation summarization for longer histories
   - Implement importance-based message filtering
   - Add memory compression for efficient storage
   - Create conversation state management system

2. Tool Integration
   - Persist tool usage history
   - Add tool-specific memory contexts
   - Implement tool result caching

## Technical Notes
- Simplified to single server architecture
- Error handling system is unified and consistent
- Basic MCP infrastructure is in place
- Database integration working correctly
- Need to focus on AI integration next
- Conversation history limited to 10 messages
- Tool context integrated with conversation flow
- Clean separation between AI and MCP services
- Database operations centralized in MCPServerManager
